        * - unit layout [Role Name, Settings Struct]
        * - settings struct: 
        *   - max: The most amount of this unit is allowed per squad
        *   - min: The squad can't be formed unless at least 1 of this unit is in it
        *   - role: The name of the unit when it is a member of the squad. This is where you rename roles e.g. 
                "Terminator" > "Deathwing Terminator" 
        **  - loadout: Struct containing Required and Optional weaponry this unit can equip 
                a required loadout always follows this syntax <loadout_slot>:[<loadout_item>,<required number>]
				so "wep1":["Bolter",4], will mean four marines are always equipped with 4 bolters in the wep1 slot
        *       option loadouts follow the following syntax <loudout_slot>:[[<loadout_item_list>],<allowed_number>]
				for example [["Flamer", "Meltagun"],1], means the role can have a max of one flamer or meltagun
					[["Plasma Pistol","Bolt Pistol"], 4] means the role can have a mix of 4 plasma pistols and bolt pistols on top
						of all required loadout options
                - wep1: right hand weapon
                - wep2: left hand weapon
                - mobi: Mobility item, e.g. Jump Packs. 
                - armour: required armour 
                - gear: special equipment needed for certain roles, like a Roasrius or Narthecium
